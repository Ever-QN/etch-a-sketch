# Etch a Sketch

This is an Etch-a-Sketch web application where users can draw on a grid by hovering over the squares with their mouse. The application also allows users to choose a custom color for drawing and to create a new grid of a specified size.

**Drawing**
Hover over any square on the grid to draw. The default color is black, but you can change it by using the color picker at the top.

**Random colors**
Hold down the "Shift" key while dragging your mouse over the grid to color the squares in random colors.

**Creating a new grid**
To create a new grid, click the "Create new grid" button. A prompt will appear where you can enter the number of squares you want in each row and column of the new grid. The minimum value is 1 and the maximum value is 100 (for a total of 10,000 squares). The canvas will automatically adjust to fit the new grid size.
